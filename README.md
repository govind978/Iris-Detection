# Description:
This repository contains an Iris Detector/Tracker model built using deep learning techniques. The model is designed to detect and track iris patterns in images or video streams, making it an essential tool for biometric authentication and gaze tracking applications. It leverages convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for precise and robust iris recognition.

# How to Run the Iris Detector/Tracker Model:

## Step 1: Clone the Repository
1. Open your terminal or command prompt.
2. Run the following command to clone the repository to your local machine:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/iris-detector-tracker.git

## Step 2: Install Dependencies
1. Navigate to the project directory:
cd iris-detector-tracker
2. Ensure you have the required Python dependencies installed. You can typically install them using pip:
pip install -r requirements.txt

## Step 3: Data Preparation
1. Prepare your iris image dataset and place it in a designated data directory within the project, if not included in the repository.

## Step 4: Model Training
1. If you're building the iris detector/tracker from scratch, open the provided Jupyter Notebook or Python script for model training.
2. Train the deep learning model on your iris image dataset using CNNs.
3. Ensure the model learns to recognize iris patterns accurately.

## Step 5: Model Evaluation
1 Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics for iris detection or tracking, such as precision, recall, or mean squared error.

## Step 6: Inference and Iris Detection/Tracking
1. Use the trained model to detect and track irises in images or video streams.

# Working of the Iris Detector/Tracker Model:
1. The Iris Detector/Tracker model relies on deep learning techniques, particularly CNNs.
2. For iris detection, the model is trained to identify the distinctive patterns of an iris in an image, such as the unique arrangement of the iris crypts and texture.
3. In the case of tracking, the model tracks the movement of the iris in a video stream or sequence of images, maintaining a continuous focus on the iris to determine gaze direction.
4. The model's performance is based on its ability to accurately locate and track the iris, making it useful for biometric authentication and gaze-tracking applications.
5. Deep learning enables the model to adapt and improve its detection and tracking capabilities through training on labeled iris data.
6. The model's output can provide valuable information about a person's identity or where they are looking, depending on the specific application.
